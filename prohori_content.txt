Prohori
This project, the Digital Resilience Suite for Smart Bangladesh, is a sophisticated, all-in-one
"Security-as-a-Service" (SECaaS) platform. It is designed specifically for small-to-medium
enterprises (SMEs) in Bangladesh that lack the budget for a full-time cybersecurity team but
must comply with local laws like the Cyber Security Act (CSA) 2023.

## Core Features
To make this monetizable and effective, the suite must provide both protection and business
management tools:
●​ Unified Security Dashboard: A single view showing real-time threats, server health,
and employee access logs.
●​ AI-Driven Risk Assessment: Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to scan a
business's infrastructure and explain vulnerabilities in plain Bangla or English.
●​ Localized Compliance Engine: Automatically generates reports required by the Digital
Health Strategy 2027 or Bangladesh Bank regulations.
●​ Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP): A mini "Bug Bounty" section where
companies can safely allow ethical hackers to report bugs in exchange for rewards.
●​ Integrated Payment Gateway: Automated subscription billing using bKash, Nagad, or
Rocket APIs for the local market.
●​ HRM & Access Control: Manages who (employees) can access which data, merging
security with basic human resource management.

## How It Works as a Website
The platform functions as a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application. Here is the
workflow:
1.​ Onboarding: A business owner signs up and connects their website or local server to
your suite using an agent (a small piece of code or a script).

2.​ Monitoring: Your backend, hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), uses Wazuh
to watch for suspicious activity (like brute-force attacks).
3.​ Processing: If an attack is detected, the AI layer (Groq/Gemini) analyzes the log and
sends an alert to the owner's WhatsApp or Email with a "How to Fix" guide.
4.​ Compliance: At the end of the month, the owner clicks a button to download a PDF
report that proves they are following Bangladesh's cybersecurity laws.

## Elaborate Key Terms
### 1. Azure for Students (The Student Gold Mine)
Microsoft's dedicated student tier offers a strong foundation for your "Zero-Cost Build". It
provides immediate credits and a suite of "Always Free" services that never expire as long as
you maintain your student status.
●​ $100 Credit: You receive an initial $100 credit to use on any Azure service within the first
12 months.
●​ Virtual Machines (Compute):
○​ 750 hours per month of B1s (Intel-based) burstable VMs.
○​ 750 hours per month of B2pts v2 (ARM-based) burstable VMs.
○​ This is sufficient to run your Wazuh manager and central security engine.
●​ Storage:
○​ Includes free amounts of standard managed disks and 5 GB of LRS Block Blob
storage.
○​ Perfect for storing and rotating your security logs.
●​ Database:
○​ Azure SQL Database: 100,000 vCore seconds and 32 GB of storage per month.
○​ Azure Database for MySQL: 750 hours of a burstable B1MS instance.
○​ This provides a robust home for your compliance data and VDP marketplace
logs.

### 2. Wazuh / Security Onion
These are open-source SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools. They act
as the "eyes" of your project, collecting logs from the client's system to detect hackers, malware,
and file changes.

### 3. Groq / Gemini (AI Reasoning Layer)
●​ Gemini: Used for complex analysis and generating natural language reports.

●​ Groq: A hardware-accelerated platform that makes LLMs run extremely fast. You use
this to provide instant answers when a user asks the dashboard, "Why is my site slow
today?"

### 4. CSA 2023 (Cyber Security Act)
The primary law in Bangladesh governing digital safety. Your project wins by automating the
paperwork (compliance) that this law demands from businesses.

### 5. Bug Bounty Marketplace
Instead of a company hiring one expensive consultant, they "crowdsource" their security. You
provide the platform where researchers find bugs, and the company pays a small fee to the
researcher and a commission to you.

## Implementation Path
As a 3rd-year CSE student with experience in Next.js, Supabase, and Linux, you are perfectly
positioned to build this:
●​ Frontend: Use Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the dashboard. It needs to be clean and
"executive-friendly."
●​ Backend/Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) to manage users, subscriptions, and alert
history.
●​ Security Core: Set up a Debian VPS on OCI. Install Wazuh to act as your central
manager.
●​ Automation: Use Python scripts to bridge the gap between Wazuh alerts and the
Gemini API to turn technical jargon into easy-to-read business advice.

## 1. Cloud Infrastructure (The Foundation)
Microsoft Azure — Student Subscription Unlike other providers that require payment info
upfront, Azure for Students allows you to deploy enterprise-grade infrastructure using only your
.edu email.
●​ Compute: You can deploy a Linux VM (specifically a B1s or B2pts v2 instance) to serve
as your central Prohori server. While it has less RAM than OCI's ARM instances, it is
highly reliable for a student MVP.
●​ Networking: Every Azure account includes a free dynamic virtual IP (VIP), allowing your
Wazuh agents on client sites to communicate back to your dashboard.
●​ AI Integration: Beyond your $100 credit, you have access to always-free tiers for Azure
AI Translator (2 million characters) and AI Search. These can supplement your
Gemini/Groq "Reasoning Layer" for translating logs into Bangla.

## 2. Security Monitoring (The Core)

Wazuh (Open Source Edition)
Wazuh is the "engine" of your security portal. It is 100% free and has no "community edition"
locks.
●​ Capabilities: Log analysis, file integrity monitoring (FIM), malware detection, and
vulnerability scanning.
●​ Installation: You can install the Wazuh Indexer, Server, and Dashboard all on one of
your OCI ARM instances using their single-line "assisted installation" script.
●​ Agent: The Wazuh Agent is lightweight and can be installed on your client's Debian or
Windows servers.

## 3. AI & Logic (The Reasoning Layer)
GroqCloud & Gemini API
Use these for the "AI Security Analyst" features that explain threats to non-technical business
owners.
●​ Groq API (Free Tier): Best for speed. It offers free access to models like Llama 3.3
(70B) with limits around 30 Requests Per Minute (RPM). Use this for real-time chat
assistance on your dashboard.
●​ Gemini 2.5 Flash (Free Tier): Best for large data. It offers a 1 million token context
window. You can feed an entire security log file into Gemini to generate a summarized
"Human-Readable Audit Report" in Bangla.
○​ Limit: ~10-15 RPM and 1,500 requests per day (plenty for an MVP).

## 4. Web Development & Backend
Next.js + Supabase
Since you are a 3rd-year student building a "SaaS" (Software as a Service), this combo handles
your user accounts and dashboard.
●​ Supabase (Free Tier):
○​ Database: 500MB PostgreSQL (enough for thousands of security alerts).
○​ Auth: 50,000 Monthly Active Users (more than enough for your initial clients).
○​ Edge Functions: 500,000 invocations (use these to trigger alerts to
WhatsApp/Email).
●​ Vercel: Free hosting for your Next.js frontend with automated SSL.

## 5. Payments & Compliance

Local Integration & Reporting
●​ bKash/Nagad Sandbox: You don't need a trade license to start building. You can use
the bKash Tokenized Checkout Sandbox (v1.2.0-beta) to simulate payments. You'll
use "test" wallet numbers to verify that your subscription logic works.
●​ LaTeX (For Compliance): Use your LaTeX skills to create a backend service that takes
security data and generates a "Certificate of Compliance" PDF. A well-formatted LaTeX
PDF looks much more professional to a business owner than a basic HTML printout.

Part 1: The User Journey (How an Organization Uses Prohori)
Let's walk through the lifecycle of a typical user, "Mr. Rahim," who owns a small
e-commerce store.
Phase 1: Onboarding & Setup
1.​ Sign-Up: Mr. Rahim visits the Prohori website and signs up using his email. He
selects a plan (e.g., "Basic" or "Pro") on the pricing page.
2.​ Payment: He clicks "Pay with bKash." The system redirects him to a bKash
payment page (or generates a payment token). He pays the subscription fee
using his bKash app.
3.​ Agent Installation: Upon successful payment, his Prohori dashboard unlocks. The
first thing he sees is a simple, step-by-step wizard:
○​ "Step 1: Copy this one-line command."
○​ "Step 2: Log in to your company's server (via SSH) and paste the
command. Press Enter."
○​ "Step 3: Wait 2 minutes and refresh this page."
4.​ Connection: Mr. Rahim follows the steps. This command installs the Wazuh
Agent on his server, which immediately establishes a secure connection back to
Prohori's central server. His dashboard status changes from "Agent Not Installed"
to "Connected & Monitoring."
Phase 2: Daily/Weekly Monitoring (The Dashboard)
1.​ Login: Mr. Rahim logs into his Prohori dashboard. He is not a tech expert, so the
UI is clean and graphical.
2.​ Unified View: He sees his Unified Security Dashboard:
○​ Health Status: A big green checkmark (or yellow/red if there are issues).
○​ Live Threat Feed: A scrolling list showing events like: "Blocked a login
attempt from unusual location (Italy)" or "File 'wp-config.php' was verified
as safe."
○​ Server Health: CPU and RAM usage graphs for his server.
Phase 3: Incident Handling (The AI Interaction)

⚠️

1.​ The Alert: One morning, he receives a WhatsApp message: " Security Alert:
Unusual activity detected on your server. "
2.​ Investigation: He opens the Prohori app on his phone. He sees an alert: "Multiple
failed login attempts for 'admin' user."

3.​ AI Assistance: Confused, he clicks the "Ask AI" button next to the alert.
4.​ AI Analysis: A chat bubble opens. The AI (powered by Groq) explains: *"Someone
tried to guess your admin password 50 times in the last hour. This is a 'Brute
Force Attack'. Prohori has temporarily blocked the IP address. To make this stop
permanently, I recommend: 1) Disabling the 'admin' username and 2) Enabling
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Would you like me to generate a step-by-step
guide for your server type (Ubuntu)?"*
5.​ Resolution: Mr. Rahim clicks "Yes, send guide." He follows the simple instructions
and resolves the issue.
Phase 4: Compliance & Reporting (The "Worth" of the Product)
1.​ End of Month: It's the last day of the month. Mr. Rahim needs to submit a
cybersecurity compliance report to his bank (as per Bangladesh Bank
regulations).
2.​ One-Click Report: He goes to the "Compliance" tab in his Prohuri dashboard.
3.​ Report Generation: He selects the month, clicks "Generate CSA 2023 Audit
Report."
4.​ Output: The system processes the last 30 days of security logs. A few seconds
later, a beautifully formatted PDF is ready for download. The report includes:
○​ Company Name & Date.
○​ Summary of security events (e.g., "Total threats blocked: 132").
○​ Uptime monitoring statistics.
○​ A formal "Certificate of Compliance" stating they have an active
monitoring and vulnerability management system in place.
5.​ Submission: He emails this PDF to his bank, satisfying their compliance
requirement.
Phase 5: Bug Bounty (Optional "Pro" Feature)
1.​ The Program: As a Pro user, Mr. Rahim wants to be extra safe. He goes to the
"Bug Bounty" section.
2.​ Configuration: He creates a new program: "Looking for bugs in our e-commerce
site. Will pay 1,500 BDT for critical bugs." He sets the scope to
https://hisstore.com.
3.​ Researcher Submission: A security researcher (hacker) finds a minor bug and
submits a report through the Prohori form, including steps to reproduce.
4.​ Review & Reward: Mr. Rahim gets a notification. He views the report in his
dashboard, confirms the bug, and clicks "Accept & Pay." Prohori processes the

payment of 1,500 BDT to the researcher's bKash account, and Prohori takes a
small commission.

Detailed Component Breakdown

Layer

Technology

Role & How it Works

1. Presentation (Frontend)

Next.js (Hosted on Vercel)

Role: The user interface.
How it works:
1. A user logs in, and
Next.js calls the Supabase
Auth API.
2. It fetches security alerts
and server status by calling
secure API Routes (also in
Next.js).
3. These API routes act as
a middleman, forwarding
requests to the Wazuh API
(on the core engine) or the
Supabase database.
4. It uses Tailwind CSS to
make the dashboard
"executive-friendly."

2. Data & Auth (Backend)

Supabase

Role: The brain for
business logic and user
data.
How it works:
1. Auth: Manages user
sign-up, login, and session
tokens.
2. Database (PostgreSQL):
Stores all non-security
data:
- users: profile info,
subscription status
(is_pro).
- companies: links users to
their company.
- alert_history:
summaries of major alerts
pulled from Wazuh for
quick dashboard viewing.
bug_bounty_submissions:

stores reports from
researchers.
3. Row Level Security
(RLS): Ensures Company A
can NEVER see Company
B's data.

4. Edge Functions:
Serverless
TypeScript/Python
functions. Used for:
- Triggering
WhatsApp/Email alerts
when a critical Wazuh alert
comes in.
- Calling the Groq API when
a user clicks "Ask AI."

3. Security Core (The

Oracle Cloud (OCI) / Azure

Role: The heavy lifter for

Engine)

VM

security monitoring.
How it works:
1. Wazuh Manager: This is
the heart. It listens for
connections from all the
Wazuh Agents installed on
client servers. It receives,
analyzes, and indexes
security logs.
2. Wazuh Indexer: Stores
all the raw security logs for
later search and analysis.
3. Automation Scripts
(Python): Custom scripts
that:
- Poll the Wazuh API for
new "high severity" alerts.
- When an alert is found,
they send a webhook to a
Supabase Edge Function to
notify the user.
- Periodically feed
summary logs to Gemini
for generating monthly
compliance reports.

4. AI & Logic Layer

GroqCloud & Google

Role: Making security

Gemini

understandable.
How it works:
1. Groq (for real-time):
When a user asks "Ask AI"
about a specific alert, a
Supabase Edge Function
sends the raw log to Groq
(Llama 3) with a system
prompt. Groq returns a
simple, human-friendly
explanation almost
instantly.
2. Gemini (for batch jobs):
Once a month, a Python
script on the Core Engine
gathers all security logs for
a company and sends
them (in chunks) to Gemini
2.5 Flash. The prompt:
"Summarize these security
logs for a business owner.
Create a compliance report
highlighting the number of
attacks blocked, system
health, and
recommendations." The

output is then sent to the
PDF generator.
5. Integration Layer

bKash API,

Role: Connecting to the

WhatsApp/Email

real world.
How it works:
1. bKash/Nagad: The
Next.js checkout page
uses the bKash API to
create a payment session.
On successful payment,
bKash redirects the user
back to Prohori, and a
Supabase Edge Function
updates the user's
subscription_status in

the database.
2. Notifications: Supabase
Edge Functions use a
service like Twilio (for
WhatsApp) or Resend (for
Email) to send alerts to
users when triggered by a
critical security event from
the Wazuh system.

Part 3: Detailed Process Flows

Let's visualize two critical processes.
Process Flow 1: User Asks AI About an Alert
1.​ User Action: Clicks "Ask AI" next to an alert on the Next.js dashboard.
2.​ Frontend Request: The Next.js frontend sends a POST request to its own internal
API route, e.g., /api/explain-alert, with the alert_id.
3.​ Backend API Route: The Next.js API route receives the request. It first verifies the
user's session (using Supabase Auth) to ensure they own this alert.
4.​ Fetch Log: The API route fetches the full raw log for that alert_id from the
Wazuh API running on the Core Engine.
5.​ Call AI: The API route then calls a Supabase Edge Function (to keep the main
serverless function light), sending the raw log text.
6.​ AI Processing: The Supabase Edge Function takes the raw log, constructs a
prompt (e.g., System: You are a friendly assistant... User: Explain
this log: [RAW LOG]), and sends it to the Groq API.
7.​ Response: Groq returns the plain-language explanation.
8.​ Return to User: The explanation is sent back down the chain: Edge Function ->
Next.js API Route -> Next.js Frontend -> displayed to the user in a chat bubble.
Process Flow 2: Automated Monthly Compliance Report Generation
1.​ Trigger: A scheduled job (e.g., a cron job on the Core Engine VM or a Supabase
DB scheduled function) runs on the 1st of every month.
2.​ Data Gathering: A Python script on the Core Engine queries the Wazuh Indexer for
all security events from the previous month for a specific company.
3.​ AI Summarization: The script sends this large batch of log data to the Gemini API
with a prompt: "Create a concise executive summary of these logs for a
compliance report. Include total threats, top 3 types of attacks, and general
server health."
4.​ Data Injection: The script takes the AI summary and combines it with company
details (name, subscription ID) from the Supabase database.
5.​ PDF Generation: It then fills a pre-designed LaTeX template with this data (e.g.,
\newcommand{\companyName}{{{company_name}}}) and runs the pdflatex
command to generate a polished PDF.
6.​ Storage & Notification: The PDF is saved to cloud storage (e.g., Azure Blob
Storage or Supabase Storage), and a link is saved in the compliance_reports
table in the Supabase database for that user.

7.​ User Retrieval: The user logs in and clicks "Download Report." The Next.js
dashboard fetches the signed URL from Supabase and serves the PDF to the
user.

1. User Experience: How the Organization Uses Prohori
The user (typically an SME business owner with limited technical knowledge) interacts with Prohori
as a "Security-as-a-Service" (SECaaS) web platform. The user journey follows this flow:
• Step 1: Onboarding & Installation The business owner signs up on the website. To start protection,
they install a lightweight Wazuh Agent (a small script) on their company’s server or computers,.
• Step 2: Monitoring via Dashboard Once logged in, the user sees a Unified Security Dashboard. This
acts as a "Control Room" displaying a simple health status (Green/Yellow/Red) and a list of blocked
threats (e.g., "5 Brute-force attempts blocked"),.
• Step 3: AI Consultation ("Ask AI") When the user sees a complex technical alert (e.g., "Port 22
unauthorized access"), they click an "Ask AI" button. The system instantly translates the technical
log into plain Bangla or English, explaining what happened and advising on next steps (e.g., "Enable
2-Factor Authentication").
• Step 4: Compliance Reporting At the end of the month, the user navigates to the "Compliance" tab.
With one click, they generate and download a PDF report. This document is formatted via LaTeX to
look professional and proves the business is complying with the Cyber Security Act (CSA) 2023,.
• Step 5: Managing Vulnerabilities The user can view a "Bug Bounty" section where ethical hackers
submit reports about security holes. The user can view these reports and pay a reward to the
researcher through the platform.
• Step 6: Subscription Payment The user pays for the service using local mobile wallets like bKash
or Nagad, making the transaction seamless without needing a credit card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. System Architecture: How the System Works
The system operates on a hybrid cloud model, leveraging "Zero-Cost" resources to remain
sustainable.
• The "Eyes" (Security Core): The system uses Wazuh, an open-source SIEM tool hosted on Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It collects logs from the user's devices to detect malware, file changes,
and attacks,.
• The "Brain" (AI Layer): When threats are detected, the system uses Groq (for speed) and Gemini
(for deep analysis) to process the data. This "Reasoning Layer" converts raw data into
human-readable advice,.

• The "Face" (Web App): The user interacts with a modern web interface that hides the complexity of
the backend security tools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Technical Implementation: Frontend & Backend
The project is split into two distinct backend environments (Security vs. Application) and one
frontend.
A. The Frontend (Client-Side)
• Technology: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
• Function: It provides a clean, "executive-friendly" interface. It does not process security logs directly
but fetches "summarized" data to display in tables and charts,.
• Hosting: Hosted on Vercel (Free tier) with automated SSL.
B. The Backend (Application Logic)
• Technology: Supabase (PostgreSQL).
• Function:
◦ Auth: Manages user logins and roles (Company vs. Researcher),.
◦ Database: Stores user profiles, subscription status, and alert history.
◦ Edge Functions: Triggers alerts to WhatsApp/Email and handles the API calls between the
frontend and the AI models,.
C. The Security Backend (Infrastructure)
• Technology: Oracle Cloud (OCI) ARM Instances running Debian Linux,.
• Function: This is where the heavy lifting happens. The Wazuh Manager runs here, receiving
encrypted logs from client agents, analyzing them against a threat database, and indexing the
results,.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Key Processes & Workflows
Process 1: Real-Time Threat Monitoring
1. Collection: The Wazuh Agent on the client's server detects an anomaly (e.g., a file change) and
sends the log to your OCI server.
2. Analysis: The Wazuh Manager analyzes the log.
3. Display: The Next.js frontend calls the Wazuh API via a secure middleware to fetch the latest
alerts and displays them on the user's dashboard.
Process 2: AI-Powered Analysis
1. Trigger: The user clicks "Ask AI" on a specific alert log.
2. Routing: A Supabase Edge Function sends the raw log to the Groq API with a prompt: "You are a
helpful security assistant... Explain this log in simple terms".
3. Response: Groq returns a text explanation, which is displayed in a chat bubble on the dashboard.
Process 3: Automated Compliance Generation
1. Drafting: A LaTeX template is created with placeholders like {{company_name}} and
{{threats_blocked}}.
2. Injection: A Node.js or Python script fetches the month's security data from the database and
injects it into the template.
3. Generation: The system compiles the LaTeX into a PDF and provides a download link for the user
to present to regulators.
Process 4: Localized Payments
1. Initiation: The user selects a plan and clicks "Pay."
2. Processing: The system calls the bKash Tokenized Checkout API (currently using the Sandbox for
testing).
3. Completion: Upon successful payment, the backend updates the user's status to is_pro in the
Supabase database.
Process 5: Bug Bounty Workflow
1. Submission: A researcher submits a vulnerability report via a form on the frontend.

2. Security: Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase ensures only the specific company involved can
view that report.
3. Resolution: The company marks the bug as "Fixed" and can issue a reward.
